Line 510 in .py file 
And 330 in .java 

I think we need to change the ordering cause to be maxi. of element rather than priority

Also, I think lines 474-482 are flawed (in .py file). Some error with the expressions it seems. Repititive kind of.

Also, they seem to be working with max. priority, while we need min. elem. value. So > or < values need to be checked and changed accordingly.
^: This happens in splicing (i.e. reconsolidating trees). Check for other areas too.

In decrease_key : Decrease element value and not priority value
